# LibraryCheckOO
Something I wrote for fun, and to test my OO interfacing. Generates some bookshelves, with books on each shelf.  Each book is random. A whole bookshelf can be listed, or just a shelf. Books can also be taken and returned.

V1:
  Returning and taking a book relies on position indexers and not the book ID [TODO]
  All indexes start from 0 for the user. [TODO]
